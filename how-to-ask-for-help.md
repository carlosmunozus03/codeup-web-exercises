Checklist before asking for help:

Did you read the Readme? Did you follow the Readme's instructions? Did you read the existing code? Are you able to
reproduce the bug/behavior? Is the problem a syntax error? Did you double-check your spelling? Did you double-check your
closing brackets, closing quotes, etc... Did you print out your variable, so you know what's inside it? Have you formed
a hypothesis about what's occurring and why? Did you search for the error message? What did you do to test that
hypothesis? How to ask for help:

Over-communicate details that you see Explain exactly what you think should be happening Explain exactly what is
actually happening Explain why you think it should be working differently Avoid using lots of pronouns. They add to
confusion.

Not like this: "Can I get some help. I can't get it to work."

Like this: "When I do XYZ-specific-thing, A-B-C happens, but I was expecting D-E-F."
