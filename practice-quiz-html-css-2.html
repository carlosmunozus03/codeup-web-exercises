        <h3>Migration</h3>
        <p>Resident to long-distance migrant. Dark-form Merlins of the Northwest live there year-round or move short
            distances southward in winter. Most of the prairie Merlins move into the southern and central U.S. and
            northern Mexico, although some in urban areas remain there year-round. The taiga form migrates from far
            northern breeding grounds to the coastal and southern U.S. and as far south as Ecuador.</p>

        <h3>Food</h3>
        <p>Merlins eat mostly birds, typically catching them in midair during high-speed attacks. They often specialize
            on hunting a couple of the most abundant species around; prey are generally small to medium-sized birds in
            the 1–2 ounce range. Common prey include Horned Lark, House Sparrow, Bohemian Waxwing, Dickcissel, Least
            Sandpiper, Dunlin, and other shorebirds. They don’t stoop on birds the way Peregrine Falcons do; instead
            they attack at high speed, horizontally or even from below, chasing the prey upwards until they tire. Other
            prey include large insects such as dragonflies, bats caught at cave openings, nestling birds, and small
            mammals. Merlin pairs have been seen teaming up to hunt large flocks of waxwings: one Merlin flushes the
            flock by attacking from below; the other comes in moments later to take advantage of the confusion.</p>

        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>Merlins breed in open and semiopen areas across northern North America. The boreal subspecies usually nests
            near forested openings, in fragmented woodlots, near rivers, lakes, or bogs, and on lake islands. The
            Pacific Northwest subspecies seems to nest mostly in coastal areas and along rivers. The prairie subspecies
            nests in shrubs and trees along rivers and in small groves of deciduous trees planted as wind breaks.
            Merlins are increasingly breeding in towns and cities, where they often take over crow nests in conifers
            planted in residential areas, schoolyards, parks, and cemeteries. During migration Merlins stop in
            grasslands, open forests, and coastal areas. They winter in similar habitat across the western United States
            and southern United States, along the Pacific coast to Alaska, and along the Atlantic coast to southern New
            England. Their wintering range extends south through Latin America as far as Ecuador.</p>
        <h3>Behavior</h3>
        <p>Like other falcons, the Merlin is a strong and maneuverable flier. A typical flight speed is 30 miles per
            hour, and can be faster during chases. Despite their small size, Merlins look powerful in flight; they flap
            their wings faster than Prairie or Peregrine falcons. During the breeding season they are highly territorial
            around the nest, chasing away other Merlins and potential predators. Merlins are monogamous during a
            breeding season, but 80 percent find new mates from year to year. When courting, Merlins (particularly
            males) perform spectacular flight displays, including bursts of strong, level flight while rocking side to
            side in the air; deep U-shaped dives; and slow, fluttering flights in a circle or figure-eight near to a
            perched mate. Both sexes claim their territory by soaring high in the air near their nest. Males also make a
            slow landing next to their mate, keeping their legs outstretched, bowing the head, and fanning the tail; he
            may bring food for the female. Outside of the breeding season, Merlins are usually solitary. However, they
            sometimes migrate in loose groups, roost communally, or spend the winter in pairs. Adults may be preyed on
            by Peregrine Falcons, Great Horned Owls, Cooper’s Hawks, and Red-tailed Hawks.</p>
