                working there, in the upper right column, the Fees section.

            <button>Know the updated rates</button>
            <dt>How do you pay for access to a protected area? Do you accept credit card? Can I buy tickets through the
                website?
            </dt>
            <dd class="invisible">The payment of Access Rights in the corresponding protected areas <a href="#">(see

            <dt>Are there schedules to enter the Parks and Reserves?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Most of the protected areas have both entry and exit times, especially in the case of
