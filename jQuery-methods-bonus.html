        <h3>Brothers, Heroes, Foes</h3>
        <p>December 20, 1943: The German fighter pilot was taking a great risk. He had seen the faces of the wounded
            crewmen and decided to spare the damaged B-17 and moreâ€”to escort the plane out of Germany. If a civilian or
            soldier on the ground reported him, the fighter pilot would face a firing squad. In the eyes of his country
            during war, he was a traitor. But to the defenseless American crew, he was their guardian.</p>
