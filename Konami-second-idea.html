        <p> A Higher Call: An Incredible True Story of Combat</p>
        <img src="img/b17-2.jpg" alt="b17">
        <p>December 20, 1943: The German fighter pilot was taking a great risk. He had seen the faces of the wounded
            crewmen and decided to spare the damaged B-17 and more—to escort the plane out of Germany. If a civilian or
            soldier on the ground reported him, the fighter pilot would face a firing squad. In the eyes of his country
            during war, he was a traitor. But to the defenseless American crew, he was their guardian.

            Now, they had hopes of reaching England again, thanks to the mysterious German ace who held his fire. One
            day, the crew would know his name—Franz Stigler. In 1990, they’d invite Franz to their bomb group reunion
            where they’d introduce their families to the man who gave them the greatest of gifts—the chance to live.</p>
